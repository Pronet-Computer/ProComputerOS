# ProComputerOS
This is a bootstrap operating system for a bare bone computer I created called the Pronet Computer. All the features for the Pronet computer, includes three LED Control Slots, System information, contrast control, a graphics test for the display and access to an Arduino Nano via the operating system. Simple to access these components via the LCD menu display and its 6 control buttons. With a unique security chip to unlock the computer, so your information stays safe. Along with an easy to use customizable power module with voltage regulators with support 3.3V and 5V outputs.
